# MissInspect

This repository contains implementation of the `MissInspect` algorithm described in Follain, Wang and Samworth (2021) and codes for generating all figures and table therein. 

File descriptions:

* `algorithm.R`: main algorithm used in the MissInspect procedure
* `auxiliar.R`: auxiliary functions used for simulations
* `fig1.R`: generates Figure 1 in the manuscript
* `fig2.R`: generates Figure 2 in the manuscript using the output file `lambda_choice1.out` and `lambda_choice2.out`.
* `lambda_chioce1.out`: output file used to generate the left panel of Fig 2, generated by `lambda_choice.R` (running in parallel on 50 machines). 
* `lambda_chioce2.out`: output file used to generate the right panel of Fig 2, generated by `lambda_choice.R` (running in parallel on 50 machines). 
* `fig3.R`: generates Figure 3 in the manuscript using the output file `25Jul.out`.
* `25Jul.out`: output file for Figure 3, generated by `25Jul.R` (running in parallel on 50 machines).
* `realdata.R`: generates Figure 4 in the manuscript using data in `./real_data/`
* `table1.R`: generates Table 1 in the manuscript using the output file `26Jul.out`.
* `26Jul.out`: output file for Table 1, which is generated by `26Jul.R`.
* `real_data/NA_finalCore.txt`, `real_data/PO_finalCore.txt`, `real_data/SO_finalCore.txt`: data file for drilled cores in the North Atlantic, Pacific Ocean and Southern Oceans respectively. Each file has three columns, which record __age of the slice (in Ma)__, __delta 13C value__ and __core index__ respectively.
